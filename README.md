"The online applications and game are related to continuous innovation, technical and technological advances in last decades. Our digital society based on the technological advancements, because the changing consumer requirements needs a quick and new solutions in the field of technology. We created an online farm simulation application named Crownking. The program is based on PHP language and has a MySQL database. The game has a huge similarity to real life because it have factors which can directly affect the growth of the crops, such as the weather, soil quality, soil maintain and the player’s profession. Our main goal is help the students in learning with the help of gamification, and moreover to introduce the agriculture to the young generation, and give some spirit about farmer's life." - Tamás Kovács
